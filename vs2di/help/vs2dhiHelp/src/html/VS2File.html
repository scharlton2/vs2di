clicking the "File" menu and selecting "New".</P>

<P>After you entered simulation setup data, you can save the data in the
VS2 file by clicking the "File" menu and selecting "Save".</P>

<P>Each VS2 file should be saved in a separate, unique directory or 
folder. This is known as the <B>working directory.</B> Additional files
