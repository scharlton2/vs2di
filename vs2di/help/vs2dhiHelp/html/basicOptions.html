<P><B>Title</B>: A description of the simulation. Must be 80 characters or less.</P>

<P><B>Length, Time, and Energy Units</B>: The most commonly used units
are SI units (meters, seconds, and joules).  The user may
specify different units. The same units apply to all data. For example, if
units are meter (m) and second (s), then hydraulic conductivity will be in
m/s. Temperature is always in degrees Celsius.</P>

<P><I>Note</I>: The program does not convert values if units are changed
after data entry. Data always maintain their numerical values as entered 
by the user.</P>

<P><B>Use radial coordinates</B>: Select this option to simulate
flow (and transport) in a cylindrical domain with axial symmetry.</P>

<P><B>Simulate transport</B>: Select this option to include energy
transport in the simulation.</P>

<P><B>Simulate Evaporation</B>: Select this option to include
evaporation (over bare soil) in the simulation.</P>

<P><B>Simulate Transpiration</B>: Select this option to include 
transpiration (plant-root extraction) in the simulation.</P>

<P>NOTE -- The user is cautioned on the use of evaporation and evapotranspiration
in VS2DH.  These processes can influence and be influenced by soil temperature.
As described in Lappala and others (1987) and implemented in VS2DH, these processes
are assumed to be isothermal.  Users should evaluate the ramifications of this
assumption in their applications.  If these processes are an integral component of
an application, then use of another  numerical model that treats evaporation and
evaotranspiration in a more realistic fashion may be warranted.</P>
