<H2>Tutorial: Drawing Area</H2>



<P>
In constructing a new simulation, the next logical step is to set up the
<A HREF="drawingOptions.html">drawing area</A>.  Click on the "Options"
menu and select "Drawing...".  The Drawing Options dialog box allows you to
adjust the size of the drawing area.  If the drawing area is too large to
display on the screen, scroll bars will appear on the right and bottom.
Top and side rulers can be set to display in inches or model units.  The
scale and origin of the drawing can also be modified and the precision of
the coordinates displayed in the lower left corner can be selected.</P>

<P>Click "OK" when all changes have been made.
