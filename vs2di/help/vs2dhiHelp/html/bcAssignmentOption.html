<p><b>Importing Boundary Condition Data</b></p>

<p>If you select option 3 (import data) above, after you click the OK button, 
a dialog box will be displayed for you to specify the file containing 
boundary condition data</a>. This ASCII (text) file as prepared as follows:

<p>Each line of the file contains boundary condition data for a recharge period.

<p>If the current selected recharge period is period i, then the first line
of data will be assigned to period i, the second line to period i+1, and so on.
If the last recharge period is reached before the last line of the file, the
remaining lines in the file are ignored. Conversely, if the last line in the 
file is reached before the last recharge periods, the remaining recharge 
periods are unchanged.

<p>For a flow simulation (no transport), each line in the file contains 
one number. This number is the specified head or flux. 

<p>For a flow and transport simulation, each line contains 
one or two number, depending on the type of boundary condition. In the case 
of 2 numbers, the second is separated from the first by one or more spaces. 
(Do not use comma or tab.)

<P>The required numbers are summarized in the table below. 
The notation (1) indicates the first number, and (2) indicates the second 
number. Note that if the flow boundary condition is either "No flow across 
boundary" or "Specified flux out of domain", then only 1 number is needed. 
Otherwise, 2 numbers are needed. </P>
