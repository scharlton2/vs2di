<P>A saved simulation file contains
<A HREF="saveSimulation.html">simulation results that
are saved by the postprocessor.</a> This file is saved in binary format.

<P>By default, the simulation results are saved in the
file "vs2drt.sim", which is placed in the working directory.
However, the user may rename this file.

<P>The saved simulation file can be "played back" at a later time
by <a href="standalone.html">launching the standalone postprocessor</A>.
