<H2>Transport Boundary Conditions</H2>
<H3>Heat</H3>
<P>You may select from the heat transport boundary conditions listed below.</P>

<P><B>No energy flux.</B> The energy flux across the boundary is zero.
This boundary condition is available only for boundary segments that
are assigned a "no flow" boundary condition.</P>

<P><B>Specified temperature at boundary.</B> The temperature
at the boundary is set at the specified value. In the model, this is
implemented by setting the temperature at boundary cells to the specified
value.</P>

<P><B>Specified temperature of inflow.</B> The temperature of flow
across the boundary into the domain is set at the specified value.
This boundary condition effectively sets the energy flux across the
boundary into the domain. This energy flux is equal to the inflow temperature
times the heat capacity of the fluid times the fluid flux.</P>

<P><B>Specified conductive flux at boundary.</B> The energy flux
by conduction across the boundary into the domain (in units of [Q/LT], or [J/ms]
for SI units) is set at the specified value.
This boundary condition is available only for boundary segments that
are assigned a "no flow" boundary condition.</P>

<P><B>Default outflow.</B> This boundary condition must be specified
along boundaries of possible seepage faces, evaporation/transpiration,
and where flux or volumetric flow rate is specified in the
direction out of the domain. For all the above cases except evaporation,
the energy flux out of the domain is computed by multiplying the
temperature at boundary cell by the fluid heat capacity and the outflow flux (dispersive flux
out of the domain is not allowed). For evaporation,
the evaporating water is assumed remove no energy from the domain.</P>

<H3>Solute</H3>
<P>You may select from the solute transport boundary conditions listed below.</P>

<P><B>No solute flux.</B> The solute mass flux across the boundary is zero.
This boundary condition is available only for boundary segments that
are assigned a "no flow" boundary condition.</P>

<P><B>Specified concentration at boundary.</B> The solute concentrations
at the boundary are set at the specified values. In the model, this is
implemented by setting the concentrations at boundary cells equal to those
in the specified solution.</P>

<P><B>Specified concentration of inflow.</B> The solute concentrations of flow
across the boundary into the domain are set equal to those of the specified solution.
This boundary condition effectively sets the solute mass fluxes across the
boundary into the domain. These mass fluxes are equal to the inflow concentrations
times the fluid flux.</P>

<P><B>Default outflow.</B> This boundary condition must be specified
along boundaries of possible seepage faces, evaporation/transpiration,
and where flux or volumetric flow rate is specified in the
direction out of the domain. For all the above cases except evaporation,
the solute fluxes out of the domain are computed by multiplying the
concentrations at each boundary cell times the outflow flux (dispersive flux
out of the domain is not allowed). For evaporation,
the evaporating water is assumed to be solute free.</P>

<H3>Options for Selecting Transport Boundary Conditions</H3>
<P>For any boundary segment,
the available options for transport boundary conditions depend on the
flow boundary condition specified for that segment.</P>

<P>For boundary segments that are assigned "no flow" boundary condition,
the options for transport boundary conditions are:</P>
