<H2>Transport Boundary Conditions</H2>

<P>You may select from the transport boundary conditions listed below.</P>

<P><B>No solute flux.</B> The solute mass flux across the boundary is zero.
This boundary condition is available only for boundary segments that
are assigned a "no flow" boundary condition.</P>

<P><B>Specified concentration at boundary.</B> The solute concentration
at the boundary is set at the specified value. In the model, this is
implemented by setting the concentration at boundary cells to the specified
value.</P>

<P><B>Specified concentration of inflow.</B> The concentration of flow
across the boundary into the domain is set at the specified value.
This boundary condition effectively sets the solute mass flux across the
boundary into the domain. This mass flux is equal to the inflow concentration
times the fluid flux.</P>

<P><B>Specified diffusive flux at boundary.</B> The flux of solute
by diffusion across the boundary into the domain (in units of [M/LT])
is set at the specified value.
This boundary condition is available only for boundary segments that
are assigned a "no flow" boundary condition.</P>

<P><B>Default outflow.</B> This boundary condition must be specified
along boundaries of possible seepage faces, evaporation/transpiration,
and where flux or volumetric flow rate is specified in the
direction out of the domain. For all the above cases except evaporation,
the solute flux out of the domain is computed by multiplying the
concentration at boundary cell with the outflow flux (dispersive flux
out of the domain is not allowed). For evaporation,
the evaporating water is assumed to be solute free.</P>

<P><B>Transport Boundary Condition Options</B></P>
<P>For any boundary segment,
the available options for transport boundary conditions depend on the
flow boundary condition specified for that segment.</P>

<P>For boundary segments that are assigned "no flow" boundary condition,
the options for transport boundary conditions are:</P>

<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tr>
  <td width="1%" nowrap valign="top" align="left">•</td>
  <td width="99%" valign="top" align="left">No solute flux</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td width="1%" nowrap valign="top" align="left">•</td>
  <td width="99%" valign="top" align="left">Specified concentration at boundary</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td width="1%" nowrap valign="top" align="left">•</td>
  <td width="99%" valign="top" align="left">Specified diffusive flux at boundary</td>
</tr>
</table>

<P>For boundary segments that are assigned flow boundary conditions of
"specified pressure head", "specified total head", "specified flux into domain",
or "specified volumetric flow into domain", the options for transport
boundary conditions are:</P>

<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tr>
  <td width="1%" nowrap valign="top" align="left">•</td>
  <td width="99%" valign="top" align="left">Specified concentration of inflow</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td width="1%" nowrap valign="top" align="left">•</td>
  <td width="99%" valign="top" align="left">Specified concentration at boundary</td>
</tr>
</table>

<P>For boundary segments that are assigned flow boundary conditions of
"specified flux out of domain", "specified volumetric flow out of domain",
"evaporation/transpiration", "possible seepage face" or "gravity drain", the sole option
for transport boundary condition is:

<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tr>
  <td width="1%" nowrap valign="top" align="left">•</td>
  <td width="99%" valign="top" align="left">Default outflow</td>
</tr>
</table>
