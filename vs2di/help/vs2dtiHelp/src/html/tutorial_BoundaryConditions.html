To view the <A HREF="boundaryConditions.html">
boundary conditions</A> window, select "Boundary Conditions" 
from the "Show" menu.  To manipulate them you must select
"Boundary Conditions" from the "Active Data" Selector (see

<P>
Boundary conditions are specified by recharge period, so it is
necessary to have the "Recharge Period" window showing when
setting them.  The user must highlight the period of interest.  
Boundary conditions can then
be set along any segment of the domain boundary (either external
or internal).
</P>
<P>
For this example, land surface is represented as a specified flux boundary condition
(green color) with the flux set at 0.01 m per day.  The concentration of inflowing
water is set to 0. except in the land surface depression for the
first recharge period where it is set to 1000 g per cubic meter for
the 10 day period. (NOTE, this is the only difference in boundary
conditions between the 2 recharge periods.)</P>
<P>
The bottom boundary is assumed to be impermeable, so the
default "no-flow" boundary condition is used.  

<P>
Along the vertical side, the boundary is divided into 3 segments.
The upper half of the side boundary is specified as no-flow.
The lower portion above the initial water table is specified as
a potential seepage face (gold). This designation allows outflow
if the water table rises. Below the initial water table, the
side boundaries are set to specified total head of -4.5 meters (blue).
The negative sign results from the convention of setting the
datum to the zero tick mark of the vertical ruler. When
the total head is below the zero tick mark, the value is negative.</P>
