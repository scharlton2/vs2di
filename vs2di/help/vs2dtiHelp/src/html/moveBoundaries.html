<P>1. Click the <IMG SRC="images/arrow.gif">&nbsp;button.</P>

<P>2. If one or more boundaries are currently "selected" (indicated by small black squares
      on their vertices), deselect them by clicking on any white space.</P>

<P>3. Select the boundary to be moved by clicking it (use the left mouse
      button). To select multiple boundaries, hold down the "Ctrl" key
      and successively click on each boundary. To select
	  all boundaries, click the "Edit" menu and select "Select All".</P>

<P>4. Place the cursor on the selected boundary. (Avoid placing
      the cursor on a vertex.) If multiple boundaries are selected,
      pick any one of them.</p>

<P>5. "Drag" the boundary to a new position by holding down the left
      mouse button and moving the mouse. All the other selected boundaries
	  will move at the same time.</P>

<P>6. Release the mouse button when the boundaries are dragged to the desired
      new positions.</P>
