<H2>Solute Balance Options</H2>

<P>Select any combination of the following solute balance components
to be written to the auxiliary output file "balance.out". 
For each selected component, 3 entries are written: total for simulation,
total for time step, and rate for time step.</P>

<P><B>Specified head, Advection In</B>: Advective solute transport into domain 
across specified pressure and total head boundaries</P>
<P><B>Specified head, Advection Out</B>: Advective solute transport out of domain 
across specified pressure and total head boundaries and seepage faces</P>
<P><B>Specified Flux, Advection In</B>: Advective solute transport into 
domain across specified fluid flux boundaries</P>
<P><B>Specified Flux, Advection Out</B>: Advective solute transport out of domain 
across specified fluid flux boundaries</P>
<P><B>Dispersion/Diffusion, In</B>: Dispersive and diffusive solute transport into 
domain across all boundaries
<P><B>Dispersion/Diffusion, Out</B>: Dispersive and diffusive solute transport out of 
domain cross all boundaries
<P><B>Total Solute, In</B>: Total solute into domain by transport and reactions</P>
<P><B>Total Solute, Out</B>: Total solute out of domain by transport and reactions</P>
<P><B>Decay</B>: Solute loss by decay</P>
<P><B>Adsorption or Ion Exchange</B>: Solute loss by adsorption or ion exchange</P>
<P><B>Transpiration</B>: Solute transport out of domain by transpiration (plant root extraction)</P>
<P><B>Change in Solute Storage</B>: Change in solute mass stored in domain</P>
<P><B>Solute Balance</B>: Total solute in - total solute out - change in solute mass storage</P>
