<H2>Energy/Solute Balance Options</H2>

<P>Select any combination of the following energy/solute balance components
to be written to the auxiliary output file "balance.out".
For each selected component, 3 entries are written for energy and each solute
species: total for simulation,
total for time step, and rate for time step.</P>

<P><B>Specified head, Advection In</B>: Advective transport into domain
across specified pressure and total head boundaries</P>
<P><B>Specified head, Advection Out</B>: Advective transport out of domain
across specified pressure and total head boundaries and seepage faces</P>
<P><B>Specified Flux, Advection In</B>: Advective transport into
domain across specified fluid flux boundaries</P>
<P><B>Specified Flux, Advection Out</B>: Advective transport out of domain
across specified fluid flux boundaries</P>
<P><B>Dispersion/Conduction, In</B>: Dispersive and diffusive solute transport and conductive energy
transport into domain across all boundaries
<P><B>Dispersion/Conduction, Out</B>: Dispersive and diffusive solute transport and conductive
energy transport out of domain cross all boundaries
<P><B>Evapotranspiration</B>: Energy/solute transport out of domain by transpiration (plant root extraction)
and energy loss from bare soil evaporation</P>
<P><B>Total Energy/Solute, In</B>: Total energy/solute into domain by transport and reactions</P>
<P><B>Total Energy/Solute, Out</B>: Total energy/solute out of domain by transport and reactions</P>
<P><B>Change in Energy/Solute Storage</B>: Change in energy/solute mass stored in domain</P>
<P><B>Energy/Solute Balance</B>: Total in - total out - change in storage</P>
