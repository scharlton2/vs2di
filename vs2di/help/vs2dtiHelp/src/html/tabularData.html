<P>Tabular data specify the relations between pressure head, 
relative hydraulic conductivity (relative K), and moisture content 
without using a functional form such as the van Genuchten, Brooks-Corey,
or Haverkamp models.</P>

<P>Tabular data are in the form of a table with three columns:
pressure head, relative K, and moisture content.
The table is arranged in order of increasing tension. </p>
