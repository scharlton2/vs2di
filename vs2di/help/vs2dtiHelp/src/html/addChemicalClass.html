  <td width="99%" valign="top" align="left">The chemical properties of each chemical class are actually
  defined in a PhreeqC input file that must be created by the user outside of VS2DRTI. In this window, the user must
  enter integer index values for each of the 7 chemical properties which correspond to indices
  in the PhreeqC input data file. The index value must be greater than or equal to 0 for Solution, and
  greater than or equal to -1 for all other properties. A value of -1 indicates
  that no reactions of this type occur. The user also has the option of selecting "As is" for each property.
  When a zone with this option is mapped, property values marked "As is" are not defined and must be
  defined by mapping another zone that contains values for those properties.
  Selecting the "As is" option allows the user to easily map discrete areas where reactions occur.
  Solution is the PhreeqC solution number; the chemistry of that solution is defined in the PhreeqC input file.
