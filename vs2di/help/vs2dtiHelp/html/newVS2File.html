<H2>Creating a New VS2 File</H2>

<P>The data you enter to VS2DTI can be saved in a
file known as a VS2 file. When you set up a
new simulation, you should <B>create a new VS2 file</B> by
clicking the "File" menu and selecting "New".</P>

<P><I>Note:</I> If an existing simulation has been loaded in the
preprocessor and the data have been changed, you
will be prompted to save or discard the changes
before creating the new VS2 file.</P>

<P>At any time while you are setting up the simulation,
you may <B>save the data</B> by clicking the "File" menu and
selecting "Save".</P>
