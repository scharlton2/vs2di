<P><I>Note</I>: Variable names enclosed in parentheses refer
variables used in VS2DT documentation.</P>

<P><B>Relaxation parameter (HMAX)</B>: Generally in the range of 
0.4 to 1.2. A value of 0.7 often works well. Try a smaller value if
the simulation fails to converge.</P>

<P><B>Minimum iterations per time step (MINIT)</B>: Normally set to 2.
The simulation will always perform the specified minumum number 
of iterations in each time step.
</P>

<P><B>Maximum iterations per time step (MAXIT)</B>:
If the number of iterations in a time step reaches this value, 
the iteration will restart from the beginning of the time step
using a reduced time step size. If convergence is not achieved 
after 3 successive time step reductions, the simulation is 
considered to have reached convergence failure. 
Best computational efficiency is usually 
obtained with a value of about 100.</P>

<P><B>Stop simulation at convergence failure (ITSTOP)</B>:
Select this option (recommended) to stop the simulation at convergence failure. 
Deselect this option to advance to next time step despite
convergence failure. <I>Note</I> Deselecting this option could
yield erroneous simulation results.</P>

<P><B>Maximum number of time steps (NUMT)</B>: The simulation will stop
when number of time steps reaches this value.</P>

<P><B>Closure criterion for head (EPS)</B>: [L]. The iterative scheme 
for solving the flow equation is considered to have converged if, 
for all cells, the change in head from one iteration to the next 
is less than this value. In general as the value of EPS is decreased,
the accuracy of results is improved and computational effort is
increased.  If the simulation fails to reach convergence then
the user may wish to increase EPS.</P>

<P><B>Closure criterion for concentration (EPS1)</B>: [M]/[L]<sup>3</sup>. The iterative scheme 
for solving the transport equation is considered to have converged if, 
for all cells, the change in concentration from one iteration to the next 
is less than this value.</P>
