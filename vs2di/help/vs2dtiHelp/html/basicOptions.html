<P><B>Title</B>: A description of the simulation. Must be 80 characters or less.</P>

<P><B>Length, Time, and Mass Units</B>: Select from the choices or 
specify your own. The same units apply to all data. For example, 
if units are meter (m), second (s), and gram (g), then hydraulic 
conductivity will be in m/s, and concentration will be in g/m<sup>3</sup>.</P>

<P><I>Note</I>: The program does not convert values if units are changed
after data entry. Data always maintain their numerical values as entered 
by the user.</P>

<P><B>Use radial coordinates</B>: Select this option to simulate
flow (and transport) in a cylindrical domain with axial symmetry.</P>

<P><B>Simulate transport</B>: Select this option to include solute
transport in the simulation.</P>

<P><B>Simulate Evaporation</B>: Select this option to include
evaporation (over bare soil) in the simulation.</P>

<P><B>Simulate Transpiration</B>: Select this option to include 
transpiration (plant-root extraction) in the simulation.</P>
