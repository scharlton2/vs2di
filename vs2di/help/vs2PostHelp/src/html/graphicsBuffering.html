<P>Graphics buffering is an option that improves the responsiveness
of the graphical user interface at the cost of greater memory
usage.</P>

<P>You may turn on graphics buffering if your computer has lots of
memory. (For example, a PC with several hundred megabytes of RAM.)</P>

<P>You should turn off graphics buffering if your computer has limited
memory. (For example, a PC with 64 megabytes of RAM.)</P>

<P>To determine whether or not graphics buffering is turned on, click
the "Options" menu and see the drop-down menu item list. If a check
mark appears next "Graphics Buffering", then graphic
buffering is turned on. If a check mark does not appear next to
"Graphics Buffering", then graphics buffering turned off.</P>

<P>To turn on or off graphics buffering, click the "Options" menu
and select or deselect "Graphics Buffering".</P>
