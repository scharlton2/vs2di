<p> The standalone postprocessor operates in computation mode when
a namelist file (for example, vs2drt.fil) is loaded.</p>

<p><B>Note:</B> The computation mode is intended for knowledgeable users who want
to modify model data exported from VS2DRTI.</p>

<P>If you have exported data from the <B>VS2DRTI</B> preprocessor, the
following 2 files are created:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tr>
  <td width="1%" nowrap valign="top" align="left">•</td>
  <td width="99%" valign="top" align="left">The namelist file (vs2drt.fil), which contains
the names of input and output files to be opened by VS2DRT.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td width="1%" nowrap valign="top" align="left">•</td>
  <td width="99%" valign="top" align="left">The model data file (vs2drt.dat), which contains the
  input data to VS2DRT.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>You may modify the model data file in a text processor.</p>

<p>In addition,
model input files exported from the earlier VS2DTI or VS2DHI preprocessors
or prepared for earlier versions of VS2DT or VS2DH
may be used for running simulations in the standalone postprocessor.
In this case, the simulation is run by
  Version 3.3 of VS2DT or VS2DH, not by VS2DRT.</p>
