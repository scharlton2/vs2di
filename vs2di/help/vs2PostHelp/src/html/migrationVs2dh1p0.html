<H2>Migration from VS2DH 1.0</H2>

<B>Note:</B> This feature is intended for knowledgeable users who want
to work with existing data files originally prepared for VS2DH 1.0.
The migration procedure needs to be applied only once.</p>

<P>The user may apply one of the following migration procedures:
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tr>
  <td width="1%" nowrap valign="top" align="left">•</td>
  <td width="99%" valign="top" align="left"><a href="partialMigrationVs2dh1p0.html">Partial migration</A>. This procedure
can be quickly applied and does not require modifying the model data file.
However, inconsistencies between VS2DH 1.0 and 3.3 data definitions are maintained.
These inconsistencies are automatically resolved in the model code. However, this
feature might not be maintained in future versions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td width="1%" nowrap valign="top" align="left">•</td>
  <td width="99%" valign="top" align="left"><a href="fullMigrationVs2dh1p0.html">Full migration</A>.  This procedure
may be more time consuming than partial migration, and requires modifying the
model data file. However, after full migration, the data file is fully consistent
with VS2DH 3.3.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<P>After migration, users may to run a simulation by
<a href="loadNamelistFile.html">loading the namelist file to the standalone postprocessor</a>.</p>
