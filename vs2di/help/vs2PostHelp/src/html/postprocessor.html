<H2>   Help for VS2DRTI Standalone Postprocessor</H2>
<P>When the postprocessor is launched as a standalone application,
it can operate in 2 modes. The type of file loaded to the postprocessor
determines determines the mode in which the standalone postprocessor
operates.

<p><B>Playback Mode</B></p>

<p>When operating in playback mode, the postprocessor
is used to play back a saved simulation. This is the main intended used
of the standalone postprocessor.</p>

<p><B>Computation Mode</B></p>

<p>When operating in computation mode (intended for knowledgeable users), the postprocessor
is used to run a simulation using either:</p>
