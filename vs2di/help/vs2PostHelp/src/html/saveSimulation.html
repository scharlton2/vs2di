<H2>Saving Simulation Results</H2>


<P>When the postprocessor is in <A HREF="computationMode.html">computation mode</A>, 
you may save simulation results for later playback.

<P>To save simulation results:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tr>
  <td width="1%" nowrap valign="top" align="left">1. </td>
  <td width="99%" valign="top" align="left">Click the "Options" menu, then click "Simulation...". A dialog box is displayed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td width="1%" nowrap valign="top" align="left">2. </td>
  <td width="99%" valign="top" align="left">Enter the "Target time interval between save". Simulation results will be
saved when integral multiples of target time interval have elapsed.
For example, if the time step size is 1.6 and the target time interval
between save is 4, then results will be saved at 4.8, 8.0, 12.8, 16, 20.8, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td width="1%" nowrap valign="top" align="left">3. </td>
  <td width="99%" valign="top" align="left">Activate (check) the option "Save simulation".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td width="1%" nowrap valign="top" align="left">4. </td>
  <td width="99%" valign="top" align="left">Select the type of output to be saved. The options are: moisture content,
saturation, and velocity/flux vectors. By default, pressure head is always saved.
If solute (or energy) transport is simulated, then concentration (or temperature)
is always saved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td width="1%" nowrap valign="top" align="left">5. </td>
  <td width="99%" valign="top" align="left">Click OK.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<P>When results are being saved during a simulation, you may not change the type
of saved output (moisture content, saturation, etc) in the middle of the
simulation. If you want to change the type of saved output, you must
restart the computation from the beginning by clicking the "File" menu
and then clicking "Restart computation."</p>

<P>The simulation results are stored in a file named vs2dt.sim or vs2dh.sim.
This file is in binary format and can be read only by the
postprocessor.</p>
