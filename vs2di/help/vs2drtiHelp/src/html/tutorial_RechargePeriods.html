There are 2 recharge periods for the example simulation, the first
lasting 0.1 days (8,640 seconds) and the second lasting 10 days
(864,000 seconds).
The initial time step size
is 0.0001 seconds.  The time step size will be increased for each
successive step by a factor of 1.2 until a maximum step size (100 seconds
for recharge period 1, and 2,000 seconds for recharge period 2)
is reached.  If convergence of the solver is not attained,
the time step size will be reduced by a factor of 0.1.  The maximum
allowed change in head is 10 m.  Steady state will only be assumed
when there is no change in computed heads between adjacent time steps.
If the applied infiltration rate exceeds the ability of the soil
to imbibe water, then ponding will occur in the simulation with
the elevation of ponded water being equal to that of land surface.
