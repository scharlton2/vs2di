<H2>Energy Balance Options</H2>

<P>Select any combination of the following energy balance components
to be written to the auxiliary output file "balance.out".
For each selected component, 3 entries are written: total for simulation,
total for time step, and rate for time step.</P>

<P><B>Specified head, Advection In</B>: Advective energy transport into domain
across specified pressure and total head boundaries</P>
<P><B>Specified head, Advection Out</B>: Advective energy transport out of domain
across specified pressure and total head boundaries and seepage faces</P>
<P><B>Specified Flux, Advection In</B>: Advective energy transport into
domain across specified fluid flux boundaries</P>
<P><B>Specified Flux, Advection Out</B>: Advective energy transport out of domain
across specified fluid flux boundaries</P>
<P><B>Conduction, In</B>: Dispersive and conductive energy transport into
domain across all boundaries
<P><B>Conduction, Out</B>: Dispersive and conductive energy transport out of
domain cross all boundaries
<P><B>Total Energy, In</B>: Total energy into domain by transport and reactions</P>
<P><B>Total Energy, Out</B>: Total energy out of domain by transport and reactions</P>
<P><B>Transpiration</B>: Energy transport out of domain by transpiration (plant root extraction)</P>
<P><B>Change in Energy Storage</B>: Change in energy stored in domain</P>
<P><B>Energy Balance</B>: Total energy in - total energy out - change in energy storage</P>
