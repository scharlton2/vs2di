<P>For the <A HREF="solverOptions.html">solver</A> panel, the following
values are selected: Relaxation parameter is set at its default value
of 0.7.  Minimum and maximum allowed iterations are set at 2 and 50,
respectively.  The simulation will be terminated if the solver of the
matrix equation fails to converge.  Maximum number of time steps is 1000.
Closure criteria are 1.0e-5 for the flow equation, 1.0E-5 for the
heat transport equation, 1.0e-4 for velocity, and 1.0e-7 for the solute
transport equation.  </P>
