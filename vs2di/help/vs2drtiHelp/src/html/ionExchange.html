<P>Ion exchange describes a reaction of the form:

<P><b>m(c<sub>1</sub>)<sup>n</sup> + n(c<sub>s2</sub>) = m(c<sub>s1</sub>) + n(c<sub>2</sub>)<sup>m</sup></b>
<P>where

<br>c<sub>s1</sub> = concentration of ion 1 in solid phase
<br>c<sub>1</sub> = concentration in ion 1 fluid phase
<br>c<sub>s2</sub> = concentration of ion 2 in solid phase
<br>c<sub>2</sub> = concentration in ion 2 fluid phase
<br>n = valence for ion 1
<br>m = valence for ion 2

<P>Four types of ion exchange reactions are defined as follows:
<UL>
<LI>Monovalent-monovalent: m = n = 1</LI>
<LI>Monovalent-divalent: m = 2, n = 1</LI>
<LI>Divalent-Monovalent: m = 1, n = 2</LI>
<LI>Divalent-divalent: m = 2, n = 2</LI>
</UL>
