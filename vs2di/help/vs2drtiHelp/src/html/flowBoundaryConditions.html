<H2>Flow Boundary Conditions</H2>

<P>You may select from the flow boundary conditions listed below.</P>

<P><B>No flow across boundary.</B> The component of flux in the
direction normal to the boundary is zero.</P>

<P><B>Specified pressure head.</B> The pressure head at the boundary
is set at the specified value. </P>

<P><B>Specified total head.</B> The total head at the boundary is
set at the specified value. <I>Care should be exercised in determining
the sign of the value.</I> The datum for the total head is the zero tick mark
of the vertical ruler. The total head at a point can be thought of as the 
water level in a tensiometer or piezometer opened to that point. If this
water level is below the datum, the total head is negative. If this water
level is above the datum, the total head is positive.</P>

<P><B>Specified flux into domain.</B> The component of flux (units of [L]/[T])
into the domain is set at the specified value. The value is either for flux
<B>normal</B> to the boundary or flux in the <B>vertical</B> direction.  The 
former approach is the more common method for specifying boundary fluxes.  
The latter approach should be employed when precipitation rates are used as input. 
The implementation of this boundary condition is primarily aimed at simulating 
infiltration on land surface with possible ponding. For any cell along the 
specified flux boundary, if the pressure head exceeds the 
<A HREF="rechargePeriodParameters.html">maximum height of ponding</A>, the
boundary condition is converted from specified flux to specified pressure head
and the pressure head is set equal to the maximum height of 
ponding. Once this conversion has occurred, the flux at the cell is monitored
by the program. If the computed flux exceeds the specified flux by 1 percent or more,
the boundary condition is converted back from specified pressure head to
specified flux. See discussion in <A HREF="vs2dt3p3.html">Lappala and others</A> 
(1983, p. 38). Note that this conversion applies to any specified flux boundary,
regardless of whether it represents land surface or a vertical side of the
domain. To prevent the conversion, set the maximum height of ponding to a
large positive value.</P>

<P><B>Specified flux out of domain.</B> The component of flux (units of [L]/[T])
normal to the boundary and out of the domain is set at the specified value. 
Users should enter a positive number into the edit box. Flux out of domain 
is specified separately from flux into domain because they require different 
transport boundary conditions.</P>

<P><B>Specified volumetric flow into domain.</B> This boundary condition is
available only when using radial coordinates. The specified value is the
total volumetric flow rate (in units of [L]<sup>3</sup>/[T]) into the domain across
a surface swept out by revolving the boundary segment 360 degrees about the z axis.
This boundary condition is controlled by maximum height of ponding in the
same manner as described for the specified flux boundary condition (See above).
</P>

<P><B>Specified volumetric flow out of domain.</B> Same meaning as above except
flow is out of the domain. Users should enter a positive value into the text box.
By convention flow out of the domain is negative, so the given flow rate will automatically 
be converted to a negative number.
Volumetric flow out of domain is specified separately from volumetric flow
into domain because they require different transport boundary conditions.</P>

<P><B>Evaporation/Transpiration.</B> Evaporation and/or transpiration occurs along
the boundary. This boundary condition is available only when the options to
"simulate evaporation" and/or "simulate transpiration" are selected in the
<A HREF="basicOptions.html">"Basic" pane of the Model Options dialog box.</A>
Note that for evaporation and/or transpiration to occur during a recharge period,
the corresponding boxes for "Evap" and/or "Plant" should be checked in the 
Recharge Period Window.</P>

<P><B>Possible seepage face.</B> Indicates that a seepage face might develop on 
the boundary. Whether or not a seepage face will develop on the boundary usually
cannot be predicted in advance of the simulation. If a
seepage face does not develop on the boundary, the boundary acts as a
boundary of "no flow." If a seepage face occurs, the pressure head
along the seepage face is set to zero and water is allowed to flow out of the domain along 
the seepage face.</P>

<P><B>Gravity drain.</B> Indicates that water may flow vertically out
 of a cell strictly under the influence of gravity (i.e., a unit vertical hydraulic
 gradient exists). Water cannot enter the domain through a gravity
 drain; it can only flow out. </P>
