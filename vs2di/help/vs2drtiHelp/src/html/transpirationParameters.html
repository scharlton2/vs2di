<H2>Transpiration Parameters</H2>

<P><I>Note</I>: All parameters are defined at the beginning of an
evapotranspiration period and are assumed to vary linearly from
the beginning of one period to the beginning of the next period.</P>

<P><B>Potential transpiration (PTVAL)</B>: [L]/[T]. Typically
computed from climatic data, using an equation such as the Penman
or Jensen-Haise equations.</P>

<P><B>Rooting depth (RD) </B>: [L]. Maximum depth below land surface
in which root extraction is allowed.</P>

<P><B>Activity at root base (RA base)</B>: 1/[L<sup>2</sup>]. Defined as the length
of roots in a given volume of soil divided by that volume. Values range
from 0 to about 3 cm<sup>-2</sup>, depending on the plant community and its stage
of development.</P>

<P><B>Activity at root top (RA top)</B>: 1/[L<sup>2</sup>]. Defined in a
similar manner as above.</P>

<P><B>Pressure head in root (HROOT)</B>: [L]. Usually set to the
permanent wilting point, defined as the pressure head in the soil at
which the plant wilts and dies. For most agricultural crops, the
permanent wilting point is equivalent to about -150 m of water.</P>
