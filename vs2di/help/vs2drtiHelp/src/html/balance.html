<P>
Mass balance errors are displayed in the postprocessor
to give an indication of the accuracy
with which the finite difference matrix equations are being
solved.  Mass balance error alone, however, may not be a valid
indicator of simulation accuracy.  A small mass balance error
may not indicate a high degree of accuracy, but a large mass balance
error is usually indicative of low accuracy.  As an example,
backward differencing in solution of the transport equation
is mass conservative and can produce low mass balance errors, but
for problems involving sharp concentration fronts this scheme will
not be highly accurate because of the introduction of artificial
numerical dispersion.

<P>
An error of 0% would indicate that mass is being
perfectly conserved.  As general rule, it is desirable to
have the Total Simulation
Mass Balance Error less than about 1%.  Errors greater than
that may indicate that the the matrix solver is not solving
the matrix equation to the desired accuracy.  </P>
<P>
The balance error can usually be decreased by reducing
the closure criteria for flow, temperature, and concentration in the <A HREF=
"solverOptions.html">solver options</A> under the "Model
Options" tabbed dialog box.  Other factors that may affect
the mass balance are grid spacing and time step size.  Reducing
these values should lead to an improved balance.

<p>In VS2DRTI, the mass balance information shown in the postprocessor
has been revised to correctly account for instantaneous
changes in mass within the simulated domain due to
instantaneous changes in boundary conditions. Such changes can occur at the
start of a new recharge period.  For example, if a finite difference
cell is changed from a no-flow condition (with pressure head h0)
to a constant head condition (with pressure head h1),
and if h0 is not equal to h1, then the model sees this as an instantaneous change
in head.  Accompanying this head change will be an instantaneous change
in water stored within this cell.  In VS2DI version 1.1, these
changes in storage were simply lumped into the mass balance terms and
sometimes produced apparently large mass balance errors.  Most commonly
this occurred on the very first time step of a simulation when
there was an inconsistency between initial and boundary conditions.
In VS2DRTI, the mass balance components associated with boundary
condition change are computed separately to avoid the
apparently large mass balance errors. A similar revision has been
implemented for the heat and solute mass balance calculations.</p>
