<P>
In the <A HREF="energyBalanceOptions.html">energy/solute balance</A> panel,
balance components for energy and solutes are selected to be written to auxiliary
<A HREF="modelOutputFiles.html">model output file</A> "balance.out".  For this
example 4 selections are made:
Total Energy/Solute Movement In and Out of the Domain, Change in Energy/Solute Storage
in the Domain, and Energy/Solute Balance.
</P>
<P>After completion of the simulation, "balance.out" will list
3 values for each of these selections (Total for Simulation, Total for
Time Step, and Rate for Time Step) for every time step in a format that
is suitable for input to standard spreadsheets.</P>
<P>
Filling in the energy/solute balance panel completes entries of "Model Options".
You should now click the "OK" button.
The next step in the tutorial is to view the textural class data.</p>
