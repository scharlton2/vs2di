To display the data for <A HREF="chemistryClasses.html">chemistry classes</A>
click the "Show" menu and select "Chemistry Class Window".  If the window
is in the reduced size, click "Expand". The chemical properties of each chemistry
class are defined in the Phreeqc input file, "tutorial1.pqi". There are 7 chemical properties for
each chemistry class. A value of -1 for a property inicates that that property or
reactant type is not used.</P>
<P>
There are 2 chemistry classes: the default inactive class, which has all
chemical property values set to -1 and is used
to block out inactive zones within the domain and the initial chemistry class, which
consists of Solution 1 and involves no reactions (values of -1 for all 6
chemical reactants).  </P>
<P>
To edit any of the properties for a chemistry class highlight that row and
click "Edit".  Any of the properties and the color of the class
can then be modified.  Once the changes are made, click "OK" to accept
them or "Cancel" to ignore the changes.</P>
