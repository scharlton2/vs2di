  <td width="99%" valign="top" align="left">The chemical properties of each chemistry class are
  defined in a <A href="https://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/GWC_coupled/phreeqc/phreeqc3-html/phreeqc3.htm">PHREEQC</A>
  input file that must be created by the user outside of VS2DRTI. In the Add Chemistry Class window, the user can
  enter integer index values for the Solution and each of six chemical reactants, which correspond to indices
  in the PHREEQC input file.

  The index value must be greater than or equal to 0 for a Solution, and
  greater than or equal to -1 for all other reactants. A value of -1 indicates
  that no reactions of this type occur in this chemical zone.
  The user also has the option of selecting "As is" for each property.
  When a zone is mapped to cells, property values marked "As is" are not changed. If this property
  has been defined in a previous chemistry class, the previous value is retained.
  Selecting the "As is" option for all but one reactant allows the user to apply a reaction to a discrete area
  independent of all other solutions or reactions.

  Solution generally refers to the index number of a
  <A href="https://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/GWC_coupled/phreeqc/phreeqc3-html/phreeqc3-41.htm">SOLUTION</A>
  data block in the PHREEQC input file. Similarly, the index numbers for the other reactants generally refer to
  <A href="https://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/GWC_coupled/phreeqc/phreeqc3-html/phreeqc3-13.htm">EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES</A>,

  data blocks in the PHREEQC input file. It is also possible to refer to solutions and reactants that have been
  defined by
