<P>VS2DRT is a computer program
for solving problems of water flow and solute transport in variably saturated
porous media.</P>

<P>VS2DRT is a standalone program that reads simulation
setup data from input files, and writes simulation results to
output files.
</P>

<P>Major features of VS2DRT include the following:</P>
