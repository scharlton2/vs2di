<H2>Tutorial: Transport Options</H2>



<P>In the <A HREF="transportOptions.html">transport</A> panel,
"Centered" differencing in space and time are selected.  The centered
schemes are more accurate than the backward schemes
and should be used whenever possible.  However, if the spatial grid
is too coarse, centered differencing may produce oscillations in results
(overshoot and undershoot of true solution).  This
occurs when the cell Peclet number exceeds 2.  Oscillations may
be avoided by the use of backward differencing.  However this option
will introduce numerical dispersion, or artificial smearing of
sharp concentration fronts.</P>

<P>The Phreeqc input file for this tutorial is "tutorial1.pqi". The Phreeqc database
is "phreeqc.dat", and the prefix name that is used as a prefix label for phreeqc output
files is "pre".</P>
<P>Within the file "tutorial1.pqi", the chemistries of the initial water in the domain
(Solution 1) and the infiltrating water (Solution 2) are defined.
At the end of the simulation, the Phreeqc output file "pre_1.chem.xz.tsv" will contain
values for pH and concentrations of sodium and chloride for all active cells in the domain
at the selected or default output times. The Phreeqc output file "pre_1.chemobs.xz.tsv" will
contain the same information but only for selected observation points.</P>
