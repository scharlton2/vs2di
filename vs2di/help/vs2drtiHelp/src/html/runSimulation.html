<P>After the simulation setup is completed, you can invoke the post
processor to run the model by clicking the "Show" menu and selecting
"Postprocessor". The postprocessor window is displayed.</P>

<P>If you did not enter all the necessary data to set up the simulation,
the postprocessor window will not show up. Instead, an error message
is displayed. You should enter the missing data and then start the
postprocessor.</P>

<P>The postprocessor allows you to:
<br>&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="displayResults.html">display simulation results</A>
<br>&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="simulationControl.html">control the simulation</A>
<br>&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="saveSimulation.html">save simulation results on disk for later playback</A>
<br>&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="balance.html">evaluate fluid and solute balances</A>
<br>&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="animationSpeed.html">set the animation speed</A>
</p>

<P>When the postprocessor window is displayed, you cannot edit or modify
the simulation setup in the preprocessor (for example, change a boundary
condition). To edit or modify the simulation setup, you need to first
close the preprocessor by clicking the "Action" menu and selecting "Done".
