<H2>Rossi-Nimmo Model</H2>

<p>The Rossi-Nimmo Junction Model is designed to represent water
content and relative hydraulic conductivity over the entire range
of saturation.  The model is particularly well suited for simulations
involving very dry soils. Water content and relative conductivity
are determined according to equations 4 through 8 in Rossi and Nimmo
(1994).  Because of the complexity of those equations, they
are not included here.  The interested reader should consult
Rossi and Nimmo (1994) before selecting this option.
