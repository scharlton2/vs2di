<P>
To open the <A HREF="postprocessor.html">postprocessor 
window</A>, select "Postprocessor" 
from the "Show" menu. </P>
<P>

When the postprocessor window first appears, it displays
the initial pressure head. Each active cell is colored 
according to the color scale on the right. You may change
the display to moisture content, saturation, concentration,
velocity or flux magnitude
by selecting with the drop-down list box. Each display
has its own color scale.</P>

<P>To start the simulation, click the <IMG SRC="images/run.gif">&nbsp;button.</P>

<P>To stop the simulation, click the <IMG SRC="images/stop.gif">&nbsp;button.</P>

<P>For addition information on the postprocessor,
see <A HREF="runSimulation.html">How to run a simulation.</A>

<P>If you view the simulated concentration, you can see
that solute plume initially moves straight downward. 
When the plume comes in contact with the silt layer,
<i>it moves into the silt layer</i>, even though the
saturated hydraulic conductivity of the silt is about an
order of magnitude lower than the saturated hydraulic
conductivity of the sand! However, under unsaturated conditions
and the prevailing negative pressure heads, the saturation
in the silt is considerably higher than the saturation in the
sand. (You can see this by displaying saturation.)
Consequently, the silt layer represents a more permeable
pathway, and the plume follows the silt layer and flows 
towards the right boundary.  Eventually, the solute flows 
out of the system through side boundaries.
