After running the simulation, the <A HREF="modelOutputFiles.html"> output files</A>
should be examined.  These files contain detailed results from the
simulation.  Information in "variables.out" and "balance.out" can be
easily plotted with standard plotting programs.  The main output
file "vs2drt.out" lists all the input parameter values as well as
requested output values.

This concludes the Tutorial.  However, it would be worthwhile
for users to experiment with this problem.  By modifying
model parameters, shapes, and discretizations
users can gain an understanding of how these factors affect
simulation results.  Relevant questions to ask
might include: How does the shape and properties
of the silt layer influence travel paths for heat and solutes?
How do values for closure criteria
influence <a href="balance.html">fluid, energy, and solute balances</a>?</P>
