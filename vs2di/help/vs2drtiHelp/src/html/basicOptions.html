<P><B>Title</B>: A description of the simulation. Must be 80 characters or less.</P>

<P><B>Length, Time, Mass, and Energy Units</B>: NOTE ON UNITS: If only flow is being simulated,
then any length and time units may be used. If solute transport is simulated,
then meters must be used for length, grams must be used for mass, and any
unit can be used for time. If heat transport is simulated, then meters must
be used for length, seconds must be used for time, and Joules must be
used for energy.

The same units apply to all data. For example,
if units are meter (m), second (s), gram (g), and Joules (J) then hydraulic
conductivity will be in m/s, concentration will be in g/m<sup>3</sup>
or mg/L, and thermal conductivity will be in W/(m<sup>o</sup>C).</P>

<P><I>Additional Note</I>: The program does not convert values if units are changed
after data entry. Data always maintain their numerical values as entered
by the user.</P>

<P><B>Use radial coordinates</B>: Select this option to simulate
flow (and transport) in a cylindrical domain with axial symmetry.</P>

<P><B>Simulate solute transport</B>: Select this option to include solute
transport in the simulation.</P>

<P><B>Simulate evaporation</B>: Select this option to include
evaporation (over bare soil) in the simulation.</P>

<P><B>Simulate transpiration</B>: Select this option to include
transpiration (plant-root extraction) in the simulation.</P>

<P><B>Simulate heat transport</B>: Select this option to include heat
transport in the simulation.</P>
