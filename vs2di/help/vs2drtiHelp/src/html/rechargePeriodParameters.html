<H2>Recharge Period Parameters</H2>

<P><B>Period length (TPER)</B>: [T]. Length of the recharge period</P>

<P><B>Initial time Step (DELT)</B>: [T]. Length of the first time step in the recharge period</P>

<P><B>Time step multiplier (TMLT)</B>: The length of the time step is
multiplied by this value after every step. The value for TMLT must be
greater than or equal to 1.  If it is equal to 1. then time step size
will not be increased.</P>

<P><B>Maximum time step (DLTMX)</B>: [T]. If time step multiplier is greater than
1, then time step length will be successively increased until this value is reached,
after which the time step length remains constant.</P>

<P><B>Minimum time step (DLTMIN)</B>: [T]. Time step length will not be
reduced below this value.</P>

<P><B>Time step reduction factor (TRED)</B>: Factor by which time step length
is reduced if convergence is not obtained after <A HREF="solverOptions.html">
maximum iterations per time step</A> is reached. The value of TRED must be
between 0 and 1. Values between 0.1 and 0.5 are usually used.  If TRED
equals 0 or 1 then no reduction in time step size occurs.</P>

<P><B>Maximum head change (DSMAX)</B>: [L]. Maximum allowed change in head
between successive time steps for this period.</P>

<P><B>Steady state head criterion (STERR)</B>: [L]. When maximum change in head
between successive time steps is less than this value, the program assumes
that steady state has been reached for this period.</P>

<P><B>Maximum height of ponding (POND)</B>: [L]. The meaning of this
parameter depends on its sign (see
<object CLASSID="java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer" id=OBJECT1>
<param name="content" value="./fig_ponding.html">
<param name="text" value="figure">
<param name="textFontFamily" value="Serif">
<param name="textColor" value="blue">
<param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
<param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.SecondaryWindow">
<param name="viewerName" value="secondary_window">
<param name="viewerLocation" value="400,100">
<param name="viewerSize" value="320,520">
</object>). If POND is positive, then the surface of maximum
ponded water height has the same shape as the land surface and is
situated a distance of POND above the land surface. This setting is
reasonable if the land surface is flat or uniformly sloping (cases A and
B in figure) but is unrealistic if the land surface includes a furrow
or depression (case C in figure). In case C, water would drain by
overland runoff into the depression, where it might accumulate to
some significant depth (case D of figure). This situation is simulated
by specifying a negative value for POND. The negative value refers to
the distance from the highest point of land surface to the surface of
maximum ponded water height, which is always flat when POND is negative.</P>

<P><B>Print results (PRINT)</B>: Select this option to write output variables
to main output file (vs2dt.out) for each time step in this period.
Deselect this option to write output variables at output times and at
end of the period. See: <A HREF="outputOptions.html">Output Options</A>
and <A HREF="howToOutput.html">How to Control VS2DRT output</A>.
If this option is selected the user should be warned that an excessive
amount of output may be produced.</P>

<P><B>Simulate evaporation (EVAP)</B>: Select this option to simulate evaporation
(over bare soil) in this period. (Not shown if evaporation is not simulated.)</P>

<P><B>Simulate transpiration (PLANT)</B>: Select this option to simulate transpiration
(plant root extraction) in this period. (Not shown if transpiration is not simulated.)</P>

<P><B>Repetitions</b>: Enter the number of periods to add. The added periods will have
the same parameters. (Not shown if a recharge period is being edited.)

<P><b>The "as is" Entry</b>: When multiple recharge periods have been selected for
editing, and if a parameter is not constant during the selected periods,
the words "as is" is displayed in the text box for that parameter.
If you replace the "as is" by a number, then the number will be assigned
to the parameter for the selected periods. If you keep the words "as is" in the text box,
then the parameter will not be changed for selected periods.
