<P>You can control a simulation using the following buttons.</P>

<P><IMG src="images/run.gif">&nbsp;<B>Runs the simulation.</B> In computation mode,
the solution for the next time step is computed and displayed. This continues until
the entire simulation is completed. In playback mode, the saved results for the
next time step are read from file and displayed. This continues until the entire file
is read.
</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/stop.gif">&nbsp;<B>Stops the simulation.</B> In computation mode,
the model will not stop immediately. Instead, the model finishes the computation
for the current time stop and then stops. Therefore, there will be a
lag between the time when the "Stop" button is clicked and the
time when computation is finished.</P>

<P><IMG src="images/step.gif">&nbsp;<B>Advances one time step.</B> In computation mode,
the solution for the next time step is computed and displayed. In playback mode, the
saved results for the next time step are read and displayed.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/resetplayback.gif">&nbsp;<B>Restarts playback from beginning.</B>
Resets the playback to the start of the simulation. This option is available
only in playback mode.</p>
