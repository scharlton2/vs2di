<H2>Setting Drawing Size and Scale</H2>

<P>The main part of the postprocessor window is a drawing area for
displaying simulation results. To change the size and scale of the drawing, click the "Options" menu
and select "Drawing...". The "Drawing Options" dialog box is displayed.</P>

<P><B>Drawing Size</B>: Specified by width and height
in inches. Defines the size of the printed output.</P>

<P><B>Scale</B>: Defines the model distance in
the horizontal (x or r) and vertical (z) directions represented
by 1 inch on the drawing. To create a drawing with no vertical
exaggeration, enter the same value for both horizontal and
vertical directions.</P>

<P><B>Ruler Units</B>: The horizontal and vertical rulers
on the preprocessor window can show either model units or
inches on the drawing. When setting up a simulation,
it is more convenient to show the ruler in model units.</P>

<P><B>Origin</B>: The location of the origin
is defined on the drawing as inches in the horizontal direction
from the left edge of the drawing, and inches in the
vertical direction from the top of the drawing. Note that
the x or r axis points to the right, and the z axis points downward. </P>

<P><B>Decimal Places</B>: Specifies the number of decimal places
to shown by the cursor coordinates at the lower left corner
of the postprocessor window.</P>
