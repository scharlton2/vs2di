<P>The standalone postprocessor operates in playback mode when
a saved simulation file is loaded. A saved simulation file contains
the result from a VS2DTI or VS2DHI simulation. By default, a VS2DTI
simulation is saved in the file "vs2dt.sim". A VS2DHI simulation is saved in
the file "vs2dh.sim". However, the user may rename these files.
