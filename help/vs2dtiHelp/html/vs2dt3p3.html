<P>VS2DT 3.3 is a computer program developed by the U.S. Geological Survey 
for solving problems of water flow and solute transport in variably saturated
porous media.</P>

<P>VS2DT originated as a standalone program that reads simulation 
setup data from input files, and writes simulation results to
output files. Users of earlier versions of VS2DT should note that, as of version 3.0,
the definition of the
