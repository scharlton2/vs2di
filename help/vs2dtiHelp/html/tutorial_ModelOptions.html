<H2>Tutorial: Model Options</H2>



<P>The first step in building a simulation is to set the model options.
We can view these for this example by clicking the "Options" menu
and selecting "Model...".  A tabbed dialog box with 7 tabs is displayed.</P>

<P>Under the <A HREF="basicOptions.html">Basic</A> tab the title 
for the simulation is shown along with length, time, and mass
units.  Once these unit values are selected, the user should
use caution in changing them.  If units are changed, VS2DTI
DOES NOT convert any property values or boundary conditions 
that were entered by the user.  A consistent set of units must
be selected and adhered to by the user. </P>

<P>Under Misc Options, the user can opt to work in radial coordinates,
to simulate solute transport, and to include evaporation and plant
transpiration.  For this example only the "Simulate transport" option
has been selected.  If you uncheck this option, you will notice that
the two tabbed panels that deal with solute transport disappear.
Recheck the option and those panels reappear.</P>
