<H2>Specifying Boundary Conditions</H2>

<P>Boundary conditions are specified by 
<A HREF="rechargePeriods.html">recharge periods</A>. 
For each recharge period, boundary conditions must be assigned to
each segment of the exterior boundary plus any interior boundaries. 
(A segment is the straight line connecting two adjacent vertices 
on a boundary.)</P>

<P>In VS2DHI, a boundary condition applies to the entire segment.
To vary the boundary condition along a segment, it is necessary
to <A HREF="insertVertexOnBoundary.html">insert vertices</A> on
the segment to subdivide it into smaller pieces. Different boundary 
conditions can then be specified on the subdivided pieces.</P>

<P>In a flow simulation, each boundary segment must be assigned a 
<A HREF="flowBoundaryConditions.html">flow boundary condition</a>
for all recharge periods.</p>

<P>In a flow and transport simulation, each boundary segment must be assigned a 
<A HREF="flowBoundaryConditions.html">flow boundary condition</a> and a 
<A HREF="transportBoundaryConditions.html">transport boundary condition</a>
for all recharge periods.</P>

<p>To specify boundary conditions, select "Boundary Conditions" from the
"Active Data" Selector (see  
<object CLASSID="java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer" id=OBJECT1>
<param name="content" value="./fig_prewindow.html">

).
The Recharge Period Window is also displayed. Boundary conditions
are displayed by colors and by labels. The displayed boundary
conditions correspond to the selected (highlighted) period in
the Recharge Period Window. The recharge period number is also
shown on the lower right corner of the main window.</P>

<P>You may:
<br>&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="assignBoundaryConditions.html">Assign boundary conditions</A> to boundary segments.
<br>&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="copyBoundaryConditions.html">Copy boundary conditions</A> from one recharge period to other recharge periods.
<br>&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="showHideBoundaryConditions.html">Display or hide boundary condition labels.</A>
<br>&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="setCornerPolicy.html">Set "corner policy"</A> for cells occurring at a domain corner where two different boundary conditions meet.
</p>
 
<P><I>Note</I>: For any recharge period, if you do not assign a boundary
condition to a boundary segment, that segment will be assigned a
flow boundary condition of "no flow across boundary" and a 
transport boundary condition of "no energy flux across boundary."</P>
