<H2>Resizing a Site Map About a Fixed Point</H2>

<P> A site map may be resized (stretched or compressed) in a manner that
    keeps one point fixed. This is useful for aligning the site map
    axes system with the rulers. </P>

<P> Before you begin, make sure that "Site Map" is selected in the
"Active Data" Selector (see  
<object CLASSID="java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer" id=OBJECT1>
<param name="content" value="./fig_prewindow.html">
<param name="text" value="figure">
<param name="textFontFamily" value="Serif">
<param name="textColor" value="blue">
<param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
<param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.SecondaryWindow">
<param name="viewerName" value="secondary_window">
<param name="viewerLocation" value="400,220">
<param name="viewerSize" value="400,340">
</object>
).</P>

<P>1. You would typically first <A HREF="moveSiteMap.html">move the
      site map</A> so that the origin on the site map coincides with
      the origin of the drawing area. The site map origin is typically
      designated as the fixed point.</P>

<P>2. Click the <IMG SRC="images/editfixedpt.gif">&nbsp;button. The fixed
      point icon <IMG SRC="images/fixedpoint.gif"> is displayed on the site map.</P>

<P>3. Place the cursor on the fixed point icon, hold down the left mouse button
      and move the mouse, dragging the icon to the desired point that will 
      remain stationary when the site map is resized.</P>

<P>4. Place the cursor on the handle (small black square) that you wish to move.</P>

<P>5. Drag the handle by holding down the left mouse button and 
      moving the mouse. As you drag the handle, the site map will resize while
      keeping the fixed point stationary.</P>

<P>6. Release the mouse button when the site map is stretched or
      compressed to the desired size.</P>

<P>7. Repeat steps 4-6 to move another handle.</P>
