<P>
In the <A HREF="transportOptions.html">transport</A> panel,
"Centered" differencing in space and time are selected.  The centered
schemes are more accurate than the backward schemes
and should be used whenever possible.  However, if the spatial grid
is too coarse, centered differencing may produce oscillations in results
(overshoot and undershoot of true solution).  This
occurs when the cell Peclet number exceeds 2.  Oscillations may
be avoided by the use of backward differencing.  However this option
will introduce numerical dispersion, or artificial smearing of
sharp temperature fronts.</P>
