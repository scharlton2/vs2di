<P> Note: Deleting an interior boundary will also delete the 
    boundary conditions associated with that boundary.</P>

<P> Before you begin, make sure that "Domain" is selected in the
"Active Data" Selector (see  
<object CLASSID="java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer" id=OBJECT1>
<param name="content" value="./fig_prewindow.html">
<param name="text" value="figure">

<param name="textColor" value="blue">
<param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
<param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.SecondaryWindow">

).</P>

<P>1. Click the <IMG SRC="images/arrow.gif">&nbsp;button.</P>

<P>2. If one or more boundaries are currently "selected" (indicated by small black squares
      on their vertices), deselect them by clicking on any white space.</P>

<P>3. Select the interior boundary to be deleted by clicking on it. To
      select multiple boundaries, hold down the "Ctrl" key and 
      successively click on each boundary. Do not select the
      exterior boundary because it cannot be deleted.</P>

<P>4. Click the "Edit" menu and select "Delete", or press the "Del" key.</P>
