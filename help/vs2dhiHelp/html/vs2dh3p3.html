<P>VS2DH 3.3 is a computer program developed by the U.S. Geological Survey for
solving problems of water flow and energy transport in variably saturated
porous media.  VS2DH 3.3 is a modification of the computer program VS2DT 3.3 for
solving problems of variably saturated energy transport.</P>

<P>VS2DH originated as a standalone program that reads simulation 
setup data from input files, and writes simulation results to
output files. Users of earlier versions of VS2DH should note that, as of version 3.0,
the definition of the
