<P>
To open the <A HREF="postprocessor.html">postprocessor
window</A>, select "Postprocessor"
from the "Show" menu. </P>
<P>

When the postprocessor window first appears, it displays
the initial pressure head. Each active cell is colored
according to the color scale on the right. You may change
the display to moisture content, saturation, temperature,
velocity or flux magnitude
by selecting with the drop-down list box. Each display
has its own color scale.</P>

<P>To start the simulation, click the <IMG SRC="images/run.gif">&nbsp;button.</P>

<P>To stop the simulation, click the <IMG SRC="images/stop.gif">&nbsp;button.</P>

<P>For addition information on the postprocessor,
see <A HREF="runSimulation.html">How to run a simulation.</A>

<P>If you view the simulated temperature, you can see
that the temperature plume initially moves straight downward.
However, the silt tends to impede the downward flow, 
so that the temperature plume is deflected around the silt layer.
During recharge period 2 (time > 0.1 day), the temperature
plume gradually dissipates due to the cold infiltrating water.
