<H2>Tutorial: Solver Options</H2>



<P>For the <A HREF="solverOptions.html">solver</A> panel, the following
values are selected: Relaxation parameter is set at its default value
of 0.7.  Minimum and maximum allowed iterations are set at 2 and 200,
respectively.  The simulation will be terminated if the solver of the
matrix equation fails to converge.  Maximum number of time steps is 1000.
Closure criteria are 0.0001 for the flow equation and 0.001 for the
transport equation.  The closure criterion for velocity is also 0.001.
Solution of both the flow and transport equations for each time step
is obtained only when all three criteria are satisfied.</P>
