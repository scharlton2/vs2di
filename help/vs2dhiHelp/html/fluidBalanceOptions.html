<P>Select any combination of the following fluid balance components
to be written to the auxiliary output file "balance.out". 
For each selected component, 3 entries are written: total for simulation,
total for time step, and rate for time step.</P>

<P><B>Specified head, In</B>: Fluid flow into domain across specified pressure 
and total head boundaries</P>
<P><B>Specified head, Out</B>: Fluid flow out of domain across specified pressure 
and total head boundaries and seepage faces</P>
<P><B>Specified Flux, In</B>: Fluid flow into domain across specified flux boundaries</P>
<P><B>Specified Flux, Out</B>: Fluid flow out of domain across specified flux boundaries</P>
<P><B>Total Fluid, In</B>: Total fluid flow into domain</P>
<P><B>Total Fluid, Out</B>: Total fluid flow out of domain</P>
<P><B>Evaporation</B>: Fluid flow out of domain by evaporation (over bare soil)</P>
<P><B>Transpiration</B>: Fluid flow out of domain by transpiration (plant root extraction).</P>
<P><B>Evaporation + Transpiration</B>: Fluid flow out of domain by evaporation and transpiration</P>
<P><B>Change in Fluid Storage</B>: Change in fluid stored in domain</P>
<P><B>Fluid Balance</B>: Total fluid in - total fluid out - change in fluid storage.</P>
